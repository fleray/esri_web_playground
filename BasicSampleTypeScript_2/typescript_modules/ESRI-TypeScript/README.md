ESRI-TypeScript
===============

TypeScript Definition of ESRI Javascript API V3.4 to v3.6  - Using AMD

The work is currently in progress, and the mapping is not already complete.

All the base classes, and modules are now declared, and available.

Use it for testing purpose, or for early small projects. We are starting using it that way also.

## Getting started ##

for a getting started access, please refer to [this repository : ESRI-TypeScript-Samples](https://github.com/frett27/ESRI-TypeScript-Samples) as it contains a quick starting build and run. This project show how to use NodeJS and Grunt to build and seamlessly run an ESRI AMD Typescript project.

This project depend on [https://github.com/schungx/Dojo-TypeScript](https://github.com/schungx/Dojo-TypeScript) providing Dojo AMD 1.9 typing.

## Helping You and Us ##

Definitions are almost complete, so starting a new project with this Typed library can be accessible and less painful than before. If your are engaging a small project using this early version, please stay in touch.
