Technical demo 1
================

This is a basic demo demonstrating several TypeScript capabilities such as :
	<ul>
		<li>class building and modules organizations with TypeScript</li>
		<li>a TypeScript implementation of an observer/listener pattern (for custom events)</li>
		<li>dojo tricks (lang.hitch, dojo.on...)</li>
		<li>jQuery TypeScript integration</li>
		<li>Esri TypeScript AMD integration</li>
	</ul>

More info can be found in the main <code>default.htm</code> page.

## Getting started ##

Install TypeScript 0.9.5 and launch the .sln file.

## Helping You and Us ##

You are highly encouraged to report bugs and feedback on this demo.

Maybe would you have done it differently ? If so, explaining us why and how is, for us, the best way for everyone to improve on TypeScript, this not-so-old language :)
